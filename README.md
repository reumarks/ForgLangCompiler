# Forglang Compiler

## FAQ

#### What is ForgLang?
- Forglang is an esoteric programming language (similar to brainfuck), whose distinguishing feature is non-linear code execution.
- It was created by @expitau-dev who is a friend of mine, and this project was created as a result of me trying to make something cool out of it, even though that should not be possible.
- You can view Forglang here: https://github.com/expitau-dev/Forglang

#### If you wanted to make something cool in ForgLang, wouldn't it just be simpiler to just write the code in ForgLang?
- No that sound's even worse than trying to create a compiler for it.
